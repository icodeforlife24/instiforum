# InstiForum

InstiForum is a web application designed to facilitate discussions and information sharing within an institute community.
The idea behind Insti Forum came from a very simple observation — despite having an IIT Bombay subreddit, we realized that there’s no dedicated platform where students and members of the campus community can engage in meaningful discussions on a variety of topics. The subreddit is limited to just one community, and not everyone prefers using Reddit.

So, we decided to build our very own social discussion platform, tailored specifically for IIT Bombay — something that feels like a mix of a social media platform and a forum, designed to make campus conversations more open, organized, and accessible.

This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and a detailed explanation of the code structure.
